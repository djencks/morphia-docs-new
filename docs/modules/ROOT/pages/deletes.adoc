== Deletes

Queries are used to delete documents from the database as well.  Using {apiRef}/dev/morphia/query/Query#delete()[`Query#delete()`], we can
delete documents matching the query.  The default operation will only delete the first matching document.  However, you can opt to delete
all matches by passing in the appropriate options:

    .find(Hotel.class)
    .filter(gt("stars", 100))
    .delete(new DeleteOptions()
                     .multi(true));
