== Configuration

Morphia 2.0 introduced a number of new ways to configure its behavior.  These values are listed below:

1. Collection naming
2. Property naming
3. The discriminator key
4. The discriminator value

=== Collection and property naming
Traditionally Morphia has used with the class's "simple name" for the collection name if you choose to not manually map the name of an
entity's collection.  Similarly, an entity's properties were named after the Java field name unless mapped otherwise with the
`@Property` annotation.  In 2.0, however, we define naming strategies.  As of 2.0, the naming strategies supported out of the box are:

1. `identity` This is the legacy behavior Morphia has always used.
2. `lower` This is simply the lower case form of the `identity` strategy.
3. `snake` This transforms element names in to their [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) versions.  For those coming
from a Python background or who work with Python developers regularly, this should look familiar.
4. `camel` This transforms element names in to their [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) versions.  This is the form
most java developers will be familiar with.
5. `kebab` This transforms element names in to their [kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab_case) versions.  This looks
exactly like the `snake case` but with `-` instead of `_` so that it looks like it's on a kebab skewer.

These strategies can all be access via the `NamingStrategy` class via their named methods.  In the case where you have a custom naming
strategy you'd like to employ, e.g., perhaps some hashing function to obscure element names, you can simply extend `NamingStrategy`
yourself and implement whatever logic you might need.

=== Discriminator keys and values
Morphia has long hard coded the choice of how to encode an entity's type in to the resulting documents in the database using the
`className` key and the simple name of the class.  As of 2.0, you have a choice to change that if you'd like.  The new default is to use
`_t` as the discriminator property key.  This was chosen in part because of its use in other systems and also for its brevity.  By
default, Morphia 2.0 stores the entity type unless you configure your types otherwise so saving space seemed prudent.

Similar to how collections and fields have a naming strategy, we can apply a global function to determine the discriminator values should
we choose.  The choices here are simpler:

1. `className()`/`lowerClassName()`
2. `simpleName()`/`lowerSimpleName()`

 These call all be accessed via their named methods on `DiscriminatorFunction` and just like the `NamingStrategy` cases if the provided
  options are not sufficient, you can implement your own by subclassing `DiscriminatorFunction` and implementing your own function.

=== Old versus New

Morphia can be configured in one of two ways: the legacy mode and the modern mode.

==== Legacy

We'll cover the legacy mode first as it reflects how Morphia worked prior to 2.0.  `MapperOptions` drives the configuration and so this
is where we'll start.  Prior to 2.0, you could simply create a `MapperOptions` instance directly.  Starting with 2.0, you will need to
use one of the factory methods.  In this instance, you will want the `legacy()` method.  Among other things, this will configure
Morphia to the legacy implementation of the `Query` class.  See [here]({{< ref "guides/querying-old" >}}) for more information.  The
`legacy()` builder currently configures the following settings:

1. `className` as the discriminator key
2. `className()` as the `DiscriminatorFunction`
3. `identity()` as both the class and field name strategies
4. Configures the legacy query implementation

==== Modern

One of the big goals for 2.0 was to modernize both the API and behavior of Morphia.  As such, the `builder()` method returns a
`Builder` that applies some updated defaults:

1. `_t` as the new discriminator key (replacing `className`)
2. `simpleName()` as the discriminator function used to determine these values
3. `camelCase()` is the default collection naming strategy
4. `identity()` remains the property naming strategy
5. A new `Query` implementation is configured enabling the new `Filters` based querying and disabling some older, deprecated methods.
